🌍 Air Pollution Data Analysis using Python 🧪📊
I recently worked on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on Air Pollution Trends in Indian Cities and States, using a real-world dataset. This project involved cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the pollution data using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

🔍 Key Highlights:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handled missing values and filtered relevant pollutant metrics.

📈 Descriptive Statistics – Generated key insights using .info(), .describe(), and correlation heatmaps.

📊 Visualizations:

Bar plot showing average pollutant levels by pollutant type.

Histogram showing the distribution of pollution levels across all cities.

Box plot highlighting pollution variation among the top 10 most polluted states.

Count plots and pair plots to explore pollutant behavior and frequency.

📍 Identified the most polluted cities, states, and commonly occurring pollutants.

💡 Insights:
The most frequently monitored pollutant and its concentration patterns.

Top cities and states with the highest pollution levels.

Distribution trends of pollutant levels across different locations.

This project enhanced my skills in data visualization, data storytelling, and insight extraction — all crucial in any data-driven role.
